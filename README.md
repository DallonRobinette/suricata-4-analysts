# The "Network threat hunting with Suricata" book

## Introduction

Stamus Networks is pleased to edit the first ‘open source’ Suricata-focused book, ``Network Threat Hunting with Suricata``.
Written by the founders of [Stamus Networks](https://www.stamus-networks.com/), Eric Leblond and Peter Manev, this project provides SOC analysts and threat
hunters with information on entry points and in-depth coverage for the most important Suricata features.

The book is not to act as a replacement for the [Suricata manual](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is
a valuable source of information and should be used as a reference tool by Suricata users. Instead, its unique ‘open source’
format will grow and evolve over time with ongoing input from Eric and Peter as well as contributions and feedback from
the Suricata community.

## Contribution

We are listing the code/text for the book here, but you can also find the latest published
version of the book at [Stamus Networks](https://www.stamus-networks.com/). We welcome contributions to the book and you can
propose updates and provide feedback on this Github. If you want to contribute a specific
topic, please [check existing issues](https://github.com/StamusNetworks/suricata-hunting/issues) and, if needed, open one describing your addition so we can tell you if it is
inline with the content we project on the book and has a chance to be accepted.
