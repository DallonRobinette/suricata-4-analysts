# The Security Analyst’s Guide to Suricata

## Introduction

Stamus Networks is pleased to offer the first ‘open source’ Suricata-focused book, ``The Security Analyst’s Guide to Suricata``.
Written by the founders of [Stamus Networks](https://www.stamus-networks.com/), Eric Leblond and Peter Manev, this project provides SOC analysts and threat
hunters with information on entry points and in-depth coverage for the most important Suricata features.

The book is not to act as a replacement for the [Suricata manual](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is
a valuable source of information and should be used as a reference tool by Suricata users. Instead, its unique ‘open source’
format will grow and evolve over time with ongoing input from Eric and Peter as well as contributions and feedback from
the Suricata community.
